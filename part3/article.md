# Docker in Software Development

When a software project starts to get more and more complex it is usually getting harder to setup the development environment. If the software utilizes many low-level libraries which are installed with the package manager of the OS and not with the defacto package manager of the programming language it is not always certain which version of the library is installed if at all. There are also many different services, such as databases, web servers etc. which the project can utilize. Keeping track of all of these and avoiding the "it works on my machine" phenomenon can get very tedious very quickly.

This all can be avoided using only a singe command by utilizing Docker if the development environment is configured for example with `docker-compose`. If the production environment also utilizes Docker it is quite useful to have both of the environments running exactly the same software. An example of this workflow can be found from a [Django project](https://github.com/osakunta/django-sivusto) which has a development environment setup configured with docker-compose and production environment uses Kubernetes. Both of those environments are still quite similar to each other and many bugs can be found before they go to the production environment. Before Docker was used in the project it was quite a hassle to setup the development environment and a lot of time was used trying to find bugs that only occurred in production.
